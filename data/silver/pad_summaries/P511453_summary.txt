The Guinea Electricity Access Scale Up Project-Phase 2 (GNEAP-2) will expand electricity access in selected urban and rural areas of Guinea. It is a US$271.8 million investment project financing with performance-based conditions. Financing includes US$132.3 million from IDA, US$100.0 million in parallel co-financing from the European Investment Bank (EIB), and US$11.7 million of private capital mobilized. Guinea faces rapid demand growth, heavy reliance on climate-sensitive hydropower, and weak utility finances that limit access expansion. The national utility, Électricité de Guinée (EDG), has high losses, low collection rates, and large arrears. The project's objective is to increase grid and non-grid access to electricity services in selected areas and improve the operational performance of the power utility. The project will fund grid reinforcement and densification, off-grid hybrid solar mini-grids under private concessions, sector reform support with performance-based conditions, and implementation, capacity building, and compensation measures. It will scale prepaid and smart meters, digitalize commercial systems, and deploy storage to improve resilience. EDG will implement the project through a strengthened project implementation unit (PIU) supported by the Guinean Agency for Rural Electrification (AGER) and overseen by a project steering committee chaired by the Ministry of Energy, Hydraulics and Hydrocarbons (MEHH). Monitoring will be led by the PIU with an Independent Verification Agent to confirm performance-based condition achievement and regular progress reports. The World Bank will coordinate partners and technical assistance, with potential IFC support to mobilize private investment for mini-grids. The project aims to provide new or improved electricity services to about 1,530,095 people, including 960,022 people receiving new access, and to mobilize US$11.7 million in private capital.

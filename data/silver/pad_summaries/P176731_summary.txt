This project supports a phased electricity program in Ethiopia. It focuses on strengthening and expanding the national grid. It targets distribution and transmission networks and geothermal site preparation. Ethiopia faces low electricity access, frequent outages, and weak utility finances. The system relies heavily on hydropower and is vulnerable to droughts. Utilities suffer high technical and commercial losses and aging infrastructure. Private renewable investment stalled because of macro risks and limited bankable sites. The project aims to strengthen and expand the electricity network. It also seeks to enable renewable energy generation in Ethiopia. It finances distribution refurbishment and modernization and transmission strengthening. It also finances upstream geothermal site preparation and regulatory capacity building. The investments include modernization, climate resilient features, smart metering, and drilling. The project is implemented by PIUs at EEP and EEU. PIUs will manage procurement, environmental and social measures, and disbursement for each component. PIUs will track results and submit biannual progress reports. A midterm review will assess progress and adjust design. The project uses performance-based conditions linked to reform milestones. Main financing is from IDA and counterpart funds. PBCs are tied to US$23 million of IDA financing. A potential US$37 million Green Climate Fund contribution is being pursued. The project will coordinate with IFC and MIGA to mobilize private capital. Key targets include cutting interruptions from 302 to 151 per 100 km. It seeks to raise network capacity from 995 to 3,400 MW. It aims to establish 20 MW of geothermal resource through drilling.

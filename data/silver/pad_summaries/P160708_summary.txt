This regional project will scale modern stand-alone solar systems across 19 countries in West Africa and the Sahel, with emphasis on rural and off-grid areas. Access to reliable electricity is low across the region and many people rely on kerosene, candles, and diesel generators. Rural electrification averages around 18 percent and millions lack basic energy services. The project will increase electricity access of households and businesses using modern stand-alone solar systems through a harmonized regional approach. It will develop a regional market by addressing policy and trade barriers, setting regional quality standards, and running consumer awareness campaigns. The project will build local entrepreneurship through technical assistance, matching grants, and targeted incentives for challenging markets, and it will provide patient finance through a BOAD-managed line of credit and a contingent grant facility to mobilize private capital. Pilot schemes will test business models to electrify schools and health clinics in Niger and Nigeria. ECREEE and BOAD will implement the project at regional level; ECREEE will host a PIU that leads market development, training, and M&E, while BOAD will manage the credit facility and on-lend to CFIs. ECREEE will submit quarterly progress reports and coordinate with BOAD and CFIs. The total project cost is US$333.7 million, financed by IDA SUF and an IDA regional grant, CTF grants including a contingent recovery grant, a proposed DGIS grant, and private sector equity, with planned collaboration from IFC, MIGA, ESMAP, and other partners. The project targets are to provide new or improved electricity services to 1,755,000 people, to supply 585,000 households with stand-alone systems, and to engage 57 commercial financial institutions in financing solar companies.

ASCENT is a regional program to accelerate sustainable and clean energy access in Eastern and Southern Africa. It operates across more than 20 countries in the AFE region and uses a multiphase programmatic approach. Many people lack electricity and clean cooking access, limiting jobs, health, and education. Only about 48 percent overall and 26 percent in rural areas have electricity. Private capital remains limited due to small transaction sizes and weak utility finances. The project aims to increase access to sustainable and clean energy in Eastern and Southern African countries. It finances three pillars covering regional and national platforms, grid expansion, and distributed renewables and clean cooking. Each country implements its own operation through ministries, utilities, and rural agencies. COMESA will manage the Regional Acceleration Platform and monitor program results at scale. TDB will manage the regional financing facility to lend to DRE and clean cooking companies. The program coordinates with IFC and MIGA under the DARES platform for private sector engagement. Monitoring will use digital MRV platforms and country dashboards, with COMESA aggregating results. IDA proposed a financing envelope of US$5 billion for the MPA. The first wave includes US$1,063 million of IDA financing. ASCENT aims to mobilize about US$10 billion from public, private, and climate partners. Partners include IFC, MIGA, TDB, AfDB, AIIB, GCF, ESMAP, SEforALL, and GEAPP. The program targets providing electricity to 100 million people. It aims to raise regional electricity trade to five percent. It targets greenhouse gas reductions of 80,000,000 metric tons of CO2e.

The Renewable Energy Acceleration Program Multiphase Programmatic Approach is a phased World Bank Group program in the Republic of Seychelles. It focuses on Mahe, Praslin and La Digue to upgrade electric grids and enable private renewable energy projects. Seychelles relies heavily on imported fuels and high-cost thermal generation, which raises tariffs and exposes public finances to external shocks. The grid today has low renewable penetration, limited flexibility, and scarce suitable land for utility projects. These constraints, plus limited local financing and technical capacity, reduce private investor interest. The project aims to improve resilient grid infrastructure to enable renewable energy integration and private sector investments in renewable energy. Phase 1 finances prioritized grid upgrades and battery energy storage investments together with technical assistance to prepare bankable projects, strengthen regulation, and build local planning and operational capacity. Component activities will fund low and medium voltage upgrades, new substations, supervisory control systems, BESS, and transaction, pipeline, and training support. The Public Utilities Corporation will implement grid and BESS works through its project management unit, while the Ministry of Agriculture, Climate Change, and Environment will share responsibility for technical assistance and policy work. The PUC PMU will manage monitoring and evaluation and report semiannually and annually to government and financiers. Phase 1 financing is explicit: an IBRD loan of US$8.0 million, a GCF loan of US$8.0 million, and a GCF grant of US$4.5 million. IFC and MIGA will provide advisory support and risk mitigation to crowd in private investment, and SRMI/ESMAP and GCF co-finance the program. Key PDO-level targets include enabling about 18 MW of renewable capacity, installing roughly 18 MWh of storage, and mobilizing about US$25 million in private capital.

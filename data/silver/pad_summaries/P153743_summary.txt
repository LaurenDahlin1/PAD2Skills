The Niger Electricity Access Expansion Project will expand urban electricity access in Niger. It focuses on seven major urban centers, including the capital Niamey. Niger faces very low electricity access, about 10 percent nationally and less in rural areas. The country depends heavily on electricity imports from Nigeria and faces growing demand pressures. Nigelec's finances and network need reinforcement to serve more customers reliably. The project's objective is to increase access to electricity in Niger. The project finances extension, reinforcement, and densification of medium and low voltage distribution networks. It aims to allow 60,000 new household connections and reduce distribution bottlenecks. It will also fund a National Electrification Strategy and measures to expand rural access. The second component supports capacity building for the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum and Nigelec. Project management support and technical assistance are included to strengthen planning and operations. Nigelec will be the implementing agency and will host the Project Implementation Unit in CGP. The Ministry will nominate a focal point to provide technical inputs and monitor activities. An owner's engineer will supervise investments and report to the project coordinator. Nigelec will monitor and report project results with inputs from the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum. The total project cost is estimated at US$65 million, fully financed by IDA instruments. Financing will flow to the Ministry of Finance as an IDA credit and an IDA grant. The AFD will finance a complementary project in Niamey and coordinate interventions. Key results include provision of 60,000 new grid connections and about 330,000 people connected. Project indicators also track non-household connections and direct beneficiaries disaggregated by sex.

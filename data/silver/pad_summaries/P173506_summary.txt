The AGREE project is a large water and energy access program in the Democratic Republic of Congo that targets selected urban and peri-urban provincial capitals and major towns. It responds to very low electricity and water access, weak utility performance, widespread poverty, conflict and fragility, gender gaps, climate risks, and COVID-19 impacts that together hinder services and jobs. The project aims to expand access to renewable-based electricity and drinking water services in selected urban and peri-urban areas of the Democratic Republic of Congo, improve the commercial performance of public electricity and water utilities, and strengthen the capacity of selected provincial and national institutions in the electricity and water sectors. It finances utility governance and performance reforms, institutional strengthening and provincial infrastructure units, private sector-based access expansion through mini-grids and off-grid solutions with results-based subsidies, and public-sector rehabilitation of networks plus targeted water and sanitation investments and WASH and electrification for health centers and schools. MRHE will chair a project steering committee and the UCM and CEP-O units will be the main implementing and fiduciary agencies, with COPIREP, ARE, ANSER, OCE, SNEL, REGIDESO, provincial infrastructure units, and private operators each carrying defined roles; UCM will coordinate monitoring and reporting, CEP-O will monitor water works, and the project will produce semiannual reports and a midterm review in three years. Total project financing is US$939 million, including IDA US$600 million, GCF US$34 million, government funding US$5 million, IFC and other IFIs US$160 million, and an expected US$140 million of private capital mobilized. Key expected results include about 6 million people provided with new or improved electricity services, about 0.7 million people gaining access to at least basic drinking water, and about 25 MW of renewable capacity constructed or rehabilitated.

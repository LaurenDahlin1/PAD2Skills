The Rusumo Falls Hydroelectric Project is a regional run-of-river power scheme on the Kagera River. It will be developed and shared by Burundi, Rwanda and Tanzania in the Nile Equatorial Lakes region. These countries face acute power deficits, low access to electricity, high-cost thermal generation, and constrained economic opportunities. The project aims to increase the supply of electricity to the national grids of Rwanda, Tanzania and Burundi. It will finance an 80 MW run-of-river power plant, transmission facilities to connect the plant to national grids, and related institutional measures including a Special Purpose Vehicle, mitigation of social and environmental impacts, and livelihood and local area development programs. The Rusumo Power Company Limited (RPCL) will own the plant and the NELSAP Rusumo Project Implementation Unit (RPIU) will implement the power plant complex on RPCL’s behalf. An Owner's Engineer will provide technical oversight. A Project Steering Committee (PSC) will oversee project performance. The RPIU will lead monitoring and evaluation and report quarterly, with bi-annual Bank supervision missions. The project’s total cost is US$468.60 million, with International Development Association (IDA) financing of US$340 million and parallel financing for transmission works from the Africa Development Bank (AfDB). Operations will be supported by long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) between RPCL and each utility, backed by government guarantees. The project’s key results are the addition of 80 MW of hydropower capacity, average annual generation of 448 GWh, and construction of transmission lines measuring 161 km in Burundi, 119 km in Rwanda and 98.2 km in Tanzania. The project also includes compensation and livelihood restoration for about 664 affected households.

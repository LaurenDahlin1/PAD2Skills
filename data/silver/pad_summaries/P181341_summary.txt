This PAD presents the ASCENT program for Eastern and Southern Africa, including Somalia. The AFE region hosts 656 million people with severe gaps in electricity and clean cooking access. Only 48 percent of people have electricity overall, and just 26 percent in rural areas. About 365 million people lack electricity and 558 million lack access to clean cooking. Its development objective is to increase access to sustainable and clean energy in Eastern and Southern African countries. ASCENT finances regional and national platforms that deliver technical assistance, digitization, and skills development. It supports grid densification, reinforcement, household connections, and utility strengthening programs. It also scales DRE and clean cooking through RBF, grants, debt and equity facilities, and regional financing platforms. Country operations are implemented by national ministries, rural energy agencies, utilities, and financial institutions. COMESA will manage the regional acceleration platform and TDB will implement the regional finance facility. Each operation will monitor results locally while COMESA aggregates program outcomes. Monitoring will use digital MRV platforms and dashboards to aggregate and report data. IDA signaled a US$5 billion financing envelope and committed US$1,063 million for the program's first wave. ASCENT aims to mobilize an additional US$10 billion from public and private partners. Partners already engaged include IFC, MIGA, AfDB, AIIB, TDB, ESMAP, GCF, SEforALL, and GEAPP. Program targets include providing electricity to 100,000,000 people across the region. It aims to raise regional electricity trade to 5 percent. It also aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80,000,000 metric tons of CO2e.

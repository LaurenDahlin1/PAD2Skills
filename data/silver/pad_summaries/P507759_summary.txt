ASCENT Mozambique is Phase 10 of the ASCENT multi-phase program. It will expand sustainable and clean energy access across Mozambique in urban, peri-urban, rural, and deep rural areas. Mozambique faces high poverty, regional electrification gaps, climate vulnerability, and limited funding for universal electricity access by 2030. The project aims to increase access to sustainable and clean energy in Mozambique. It finances on-grid expansion and reinforcement to electrify cost-effective areas. It also strengthens technical standards and utility performance through performance-based conditions. It scales an off-grid finance facility called +ENERGIA for solar home systems, mesh-grids, mini-grids, and clean cooking. The project also supports utility digitalization, outage management, and capacity building for institutions. The Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy, Electricidade de Moçambique, and Fundo de Energia will implement the project. A strengthened project implementation unit will manage works and procurement. An inter-ministerial steering committee will guide policy and coordination among agencies. The +ENERGIA facility will be managed by a facility manager and verified by an Independent Verification Agent. Monitoring will use digital platforms and PIU quarterly and semiannual reports. The project financing totals US$131 million, from a US$100 million IDA grant and a US$31 million MEFA-MDTF grant. Private capital mobilization is modest at about US$10 million now, with more expected later. Parallel contributions from EDM and other donors are anticipated to accelerate scale. Key results include 145,970 household grid connections and 70,000 off-grid household connections. The project will also support 20,000 households to gain new clean cooking solutions. The PDO-level indicator tracks the number of people provided with access to electricity.

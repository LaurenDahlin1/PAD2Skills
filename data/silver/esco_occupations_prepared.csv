sound designer & music composer Sound designers develop a sound design concept for a performance and supervise the execution of it. Their work is based on research and artistic vision. Their design is influenced by and influences other designs and must be conform with these designs and the overall artistic vision. Therefore, the designers work closely with artistic directors, operators and the artistic team. Sound designers prepare audio fragments to be used in a performance, which can involve recording, composing, manipulating and editing. Sound designers develop plans, cue lists and other documentation to support the operators and production crew. Sound designers sometimes also work as autonomous artists, creating sound art outside a performance context. analyse the artistic concept based on stage actions, monitor developments in technology used for design, work ergonomically, understand artistic concepts, mix multi-track recordings, safeguard artistic quality of performance, develop an artistic framework, analyse music score, monitor sociological trends, analyse the scenography, perform quality control of design during a run, use specialised design software, communicate during show, update design results during rehearsals, attend rehearsals, research new ideas, conduct costume research, adapt to artists' creative demands, coordinate audio system programmes, program sound cues, verify feasibility, prevent fire in a performance environment, operate an audio mixing console, use communication equipment, mix sound in a live situation, work safely with chemicals, contextualise artistic work, coach staff for running the performance, meet deadlines, analyse a script, record multi-track sound, propose improvements to artistic production, work safely with mobile electrical systems under supervision, work with respect for own safety, present artistic design proposals, use audio reproduction software, define artistic approach, adapt existing designs to changed circumstances, use technical documentation, develop design concept, plan audiovisual recording, operate sound live, keep up with trends, develop design ideas cooperatively"
